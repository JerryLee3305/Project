⑥ Quick PCK(Production Choke) Restriction
The PCK is a control valve installed at the beginning of the production unit and is responsible for well control at the surface. The expression “quick restriction in PCK” is not well defined in the literature but is an English version of a term that is widely used internally at Petrobras. For this expression to be correctly used, the restriction must occur with an amplitude above a stipulated reference (e.g., 5%) and in a short time (e.g., less than 10 s).
When this type of valve is manually operated, unwanted quick restrictions may eventually occur due to operational problems.
Identifying this event automatically is also desirable because unwanted
restrictions can be reversed more quickly

⑧ Hydrates in Production Lines

Hydrate in Production Line
Hydrate is one of the biggest problems in the oil industry. It is defined as a crystalline compound that is formed by water and natural gas
and therefore resembles ice. As its formation requires the presence of
water and natural gas, in addition to high pressures and low temperatures, oil pipelines in which dead oil flows do not suffer from this type of anomaly. Its occurrence is more frequent in gas pipelines and gas producing wells. 

However, hydrates can also be formed in oil-producing wells, to the point of totally interrupting their flow. Avoiding occurrences of this type of undesirable event means avoiding production losses for days or even weeks. In certain cases,
high costs of unblocking the production line are also avoided

### Overview of equipment

A subsea Christmas tree is a type of equipment installed on the seabed and is basically composed of valves and sensors operated remotely through an electro-hydraulic
umbilical. A Permanent Downhole Gauge (PDG) and a Temperature and Pressure Transducer (TPT) are devices that contain pressure and temperature sensors, respectively. The PDG remains fixed in a certain position of the production tubing, and the TPT is part of the subsea Christmas tree.

Variables

① P-PDG (Unit: Pa): Pressure at permanent downhole gauge

② P-TPT (Unit: Pa): Pressure at temperature/pressure transducer  

③ T-TPT (Unit: °C): Temperature at temperature/pressure transducer

④ P-MON-CKP (Unit: Pa): Pressure upstream of production choke

⑤ T-JUS-CKP (Unit: °C): Temperature downstream of production choke

⑥ P-JUS-CKGL (Unit: Pa): Pressure upstream of the gas lift choke

⑦ T-JUS-CKGL (Unit: °C): Temperature upstream of the gas lift choke

⑧ QGL (Unit: sm3/s): Gas lift flow rate

6번 label Choke restriction 

- 1,8번은 상관 관계 없음, 7번은 X
- Low importance
    - 2,3
    - 6 : 지속적 상승 또는 감소 —> CKGL
- High importance - CKP 위주로
    - 4 : 지속적 상승 = Pressure increase
    - 5 : 지속적 감소 = Temperature decrease
    

8번 label -hydrates

- PDG pressure 상승
- TPT pressure 상승, T 감소
- CKP pressure 감소, T 감소

TPT 부분에서 hydrates에 의해서 choking 발생 → 압력 상승 → production pipeline choke

위에서 말한 hydrates가 만들어지고 high P, low T 조건과도 부합함. 따라서 TPT의 압력 증가와 온도가 감소한다면 hydrates formation에 의한 이상이 발생한다고 볼 수 있다. 

종합적으로 개별적인 데이터 하나하나를 이상치로 판단하는 것보다는 추세를 보며 판단하는게 더 좋은 결과를 나타낼 것으로 예상
